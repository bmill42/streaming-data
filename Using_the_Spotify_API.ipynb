        "As we've learned, Spotify's technology and business model depend heavily on **metadata** about the music the company hosts and streams. While we've already seen how to download our own streaming data, Spotify also makes much of its other metadata available via an API, or Application Programming Interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "An API is a system that connects multiple software programs, usually when one application needs to request data from another. Computers use many kinds of APIs, including ones that allow programs to communicate with the underlying operating system, but a common type used by many modern applications is a **Web API**, which lets an app request information from some external source on the internet.\n",
        "\n",
        "APIs drive many of the web apps we use every day, and also allow programmers to interact with data sources in ways that can be more flexible than the standard app allows. For example, when you search a website like Travelocity or Kayak for flights or hotels, those sites are using APIs to request information from many different airlines or hotel chains in order to present you with all the search results in one place. The API provides some structure and limitations on what kinds of data can be requested: Kayak can't access Delta Airlines' data directly, but can make certain kinds of requests through the API and can expect certain kinds of data in response.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, until some recent changes, it was easy to use the Twitter API to create Twitter bots that could do things like post automatic weather updates, or respond to tweets containing particular words.\n",
        "\n",
        "And from [Spotify's own documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api), the \"Spotify Web API enables the creation of applications that can interact with Spotify's streaming service, such as retrieving content metadata, getting recommendations, creating and managing playlists, or controlling playback.\" But the API also imposes limits on things like the rate at which an app can request data, which protects Spotify's servers from being overloaded (potentially by malicious attacks).\n"

Behind the scenes, working with an API is similar to loading a webpage: your computer sends an HTTP request to `GET` some kind of information, and if the request has the correct format and credentials, Spotify sends back the information you asked for. The `spotipy` library handles all of this, so that we can just write Python code asking for things like lists of artists or albums and receive data in standard Python structures without worrying about how web communications work.\n",
